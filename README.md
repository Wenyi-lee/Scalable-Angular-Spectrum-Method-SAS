# Scalable Angular Spectrum Method SAS
Implementations of the Angular Spectrum Method for optical wave propagation.

# Python
Implementation in Python and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Hence, it can be used within neural networks and automatic differentiation.
See this [Jupyter notebook](SAS_pytorch.ipynb).


# Julia Code
Tested with [Julia 1.8.5](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Download the software and install it on your computer. 
Open the REPL and type:
```julia
julia > ]add Pluto

julia > using Pluto
```
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) is an interactive notebook environment.
Download the file [SAS_examples.jl](SAS_examples.jl). From within Pluto, open this file.
Everything should go fine from now on.
